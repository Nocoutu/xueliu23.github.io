I am currently a Lecturer at Southeast University in Nanjing, China.
I was Postdoc at University of Science and Technology of China with co-advisor Wen Huang. I was a Ph.D. Student in Brigham Young University, and my supervisor was Professor Kening Lu.

Research interest: Dynamical systems and Ergodic theory. I'm mainly concerned with the complex phenomena in deterministic and random dynamical systems, which include statistic behaviour such as decay of correlation, geometric behaviour such as horseshoe and multifractal analysis.
